# Fork Sync Workflow

Comprehensive skill for managing the Minion fork workflow, syncing with upstream, and updating all development branches.

## Critical Principle: Mirror is a Clean Mirror

**IMPORTANT**: The `mirror` branch must ALWAYS be a clean mirror of `upstream/main`. It should NEVER contain custom commits.

### Workflow for Custom Changes

When `mirror` has diverged from upstream (contains custom commits):

1. **Verify custom commits are on DEV/main**: Check that all custom work exists on development branches
2. **Reset mirror to upstream**: `git reset --hard upstream/main`
3. **Force push mirror**: `git push --force-with-lease origin mirror`
4. **Custom work remains safe**: All custom commits stay on DEV/main/feature branches

### Detection and Resolution

```bash
# Check if mirror has diverged
git fetch upstream
git log --oneline upstream/main..mirror

# If output shows commits (mirror has diverged):
# 1. Verify commits are on DEV/main
git log --oneline DEV | head -20
git log --oneline main | head -20

# 2. Reset mirror to upstream
git checkout mirror
git reset --hard upstream/main
git push --force-with-lease origin mirror
```

## Branch Structure

This fork maintains a simplified branch hierarchy:

```
upstream/main (source of truth)
    ↓
mirror (clean mirror - NO custom commits)
    ↓
DEV (integration branch: mirror + all custom work)
    ↓
main (production - deployed to servers, Docker tag: prd)
```

### Branch Purposes

- **mirror**: Clean mirror of upstream/main, NEVER contains custom work
- **DEV**: Integration branch containing all custom features and work
- **main**: Production branch, merge from DEV when ready for deployment
- **Feature branches** (manual): Update manually by rebasing or merging from DEV

## Core Workflow

### Phase 0: Clean Mirror (if needed)

**Goal**: Ensure mirror is a clean mirror of upstream

```bash
# Check if mirror has diverged
git checkout mirror
git fetch upstream
git log --oneline upstream/main..mirror

# If commits shown, mirror has diverged - fix it:
# 1. Verify custom commits exist on DEV/main
git log --oneline DEV | grep "CustomCommit"
git log --oneline main | grep "CustomCommit"

# 2. Reset mirror to upstream
git reset --hard upstream/main
git push --force-with-lease origin mirror
```

**When to run**: Any time mirror has custom commits (detected by divergence check)

### Phase 1: Sync Mirror with Upstream

**Goal**: Update local mirror to match upstream/main

```bash
# Fetch latest from upstream
git fetch upstream

# Switch to mirror (should already be clean)
git checkout mirror

# Fast-forward merge upstream changes (should succeed now)
git merge --ff-only upstream/main

# Push to fork
git push origin mirror
```

**Expected**: Fast-forward merge, no conflicts (since mirror is clean mirror)

### Phase 1.5: Pre-Merge Evaluation

**Goal**: Analyze upstream changes before merging to understand impact and plan conflict resolution

```bash
# Compare mirror (upstream) with main to see what changed
git diff main..mirror --stat | head -50
git log --oneline main..mirror --no-merges | head -30

# Generate per-file change analysis
git diff main..mirror --name-status | sort
```

**Evaluation Process**:

1. **Categorize changes by type**:
   - Core infrastructure (package.json, workflows, build config)
   - New features (new files/directories)
   - Refactors (modified existing files)
   - Deletions (removed files - check if fork depends on them)
   - Documentation updates

2. **For each significant change, evaluate**:
   - **Worth merging?** Does this fix bugs, add useful features, or improve architecture?
   - **Breaking changes?** Does upstream remove/change APIs that fork code depends on?
   - **Conflicts with fork features?** Does upstream implement something we already have differently?
   - **Dependencies?** Do new features require config changes or have dependencies on other changes?

3. **Identify high-risk files**:
   - Files modified by both upstream and fork (will conflict)
   - Core files like package.json, tsconfig.json, workflow files
   - Files the fork heavily customized (banner.ts, rebrand-related files)

4. **Plan merge strategy**:
   - **Accept wholesale**: Upstream changes that don't conflict (most files)
   - **Manual merge**: Files with conflicts - plan which hunks to keep from each side
   - **Reject**: Upstream changes that break fork features (rare - document why)
   - **Adapt after merge**: Fork features that need updates to work with upstream changes

5. **Document evaluation**:
   Create a mental (or written) map of:
   - Major upstream features being merged
   - Expected conflicts and resolution strategy
   - Files that will need post-merge fixes
   - Tests that might break and need updates

**Expected time**: 5-10 minutes for review

**Output**: Clear understanding of what's changing and plan for Phase 2 merge

### Phase 1.6: Systematic Upstream Evaluation

**When to use**: Gap exceeds ~50 commits, or a bulk merge produced too many conflicts to resolve in one session.

**Goal**: Build a module-by-module merge shopping list — a conflict resolution playbook that guides Phase 2.

**Core principle**: Full merge (`git merge mirror`) remains the integration strategy. The evaluation produces a plan for **how to resolve each conflict**, not which commits to cherry-pick.

**State file**: `.claude/skills/fork-sync/state/evaluation.json`
**Reference**: See `evaluation-reference.md` for detailed heuristics, schema, and module presentation format.

#### Resumability

On invocation, check for existing state:

1. If `state/evaluation.json` exists and `snapshot.mirrorHead` matches current `mirror` HEAD → **resume** from `cursor.currentModuleIndex`
2. If state exists but mirror has advanced → warn user, offer incremental update or fresh start
3. If no state file → run initialization (Steps 1–3)

#### Step 1: Initialize

Snapshot current branch state and build the commit inventory.

```bash
# Record snapshot
MERGE_BASE=$(git merge-base mirror DEV)
MIRROR_HEAD=$(git rev-parse mirror)
DEV_HEAD=$(git rev-parse DEV)
UPSTREAM_COUNT=$(git rev-list --count $MERGE_BASE..mirror)
FORK_COUNT=$(git rev-list --count $MERGE_BASE..DEV)

# Build full commit list grouped by module (src/ subdirectory)
git log --oneline --name-only $MERGE_BASE..mirror
```

#### Step 2: Build Fork Feature Index

Identify which files have actual fork functionality (not just rebrand renames). This determines conflict risk per module.

```bash
# Files changed in fork
git diff --name-only $MERGE_BASE..DEV

# For each: classify as rebrand-only, config-only, or functional
git diff $MERGE_BASE..DEV -- <file>
```

Record functional changes in `forkFeatureIndex` with fork commit SHAs, feature description, and recommended resolution.

#### Step 3: Auto-Categorize

Apply heuristic tiers (see `evaluation-reference.md` Section B) to tag each commit:

- **Tier 1** — Commit message patterns (test/docs/style → skip, feat/fix → review, security → accept)
- **Tier 2** — File path overrides (native apps → accept, fork-feature files → review)
- **Tier 3** — Combination rules (resolve Tier 1/2 conflicts)

Expected: ~87% of commits auto-categorized, ~13% need manual review.

#### Step 4: Interactive Module Evaluation

Present each module to the user in priority order (see `evaluation-reference.md` Section C). For each module show:

- Commit count and conflict file count
- Fork features at risk (from `forkFeatureIndex`)
- Auto-categorization breakdown
- Commits needing manual review

User decides per module: **Accept all** | **Review individually** | **Defer** | **Skip module**

Save state after each module decision. This step is **resumable** — the user can stop and resume across sessions.

#### Step 5: Generate Merge Plan

After all modules are evaluated, compile the merge shopping list:

- **keepOurs**: Files where fork version wins
- **acceptWithRebrand**: Files needing only name substitution after merge
- **extensionPackageJson**: Accept upstream + fix `@nikolasp98/minion` dep
- **manualMerge**: Files needing hunk-by-hunk resolution (with notes)
- **autoAccept**: Files that merge cleanly

Export to `UPSTREAM_MERGE_EVALUATION.md` at project root. This document becomes the playbook for Phase 2.

**Expected time**: 15–30 minutes for first run (initialization + high-priority modules), 5–10 minutes per resumed session

### Phase 1.7: Generate Resolution Script

**Trigger:** Run immediately after Phase 1.6 Step 5 (shopping list finalized). Always run before Phase 2.

**Goal**: Convert the evaluation shopping list into a deterministic bash script that resolves all mechanical merge conflicts in seconds.

**Output**: `.claude/skills/fork-sync/scripts/resolve-conflicts.sh`

**Generation instructions:**

Read `evaluation.json`'s `mergeShoppingList`. Produce a script with this structure — emit one `resolve` call per file in each category:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Auto-generated by fork-sync Phase 1.7
# Generated: <ISO-8601>
# Mirror head: <git rev-parse mirror>
# Counts: <keepOurs N> keepOurs, <manualMerge N> manualMerge,
#         <acceptWithRebrand N> acceptWithRebrand, <extensionPackageJson N> extpkg,
#         <acceptDeletion N> deletions, <autoAccept N> autoAccept
# DO NOT EDIT — regenerate via Phase 1.7

set -e
# NOTE: Requires GNU sed (Linux default). On macOS: brew install gnu-sed && alias sed=gsed

REBRAND='s/from '"'"'openclaw'"'"'/from '"'"'@nikolasp98\/minion'"'"'/g; s/from "openclaw"/from "@nikolasp98\/minion"/g; s/require('"'"'openclaw'"'"')/require('"'"'@nikolasp98\/minion'"'"')/g; s/require("openclaw")/require("@nikolasp98\/minion")/g'
EXT_PKG='s/"openclaw": "workspace:\*"/"@nikolasp98\/minion": "workspace:*"/g'

resolve() {
  local f="$1" strategy="$2"
  # Idempotent: skip if not currently conflicted
  git ls-files -u -- "$f" | grep -q . || return 0
  case "$strategy" in
    ours)    git checkout --ours "$f" 2>/dev/null && git add "$f" && echo "✓ ours:    $f" ;;
    theirs)  git checkout --theirs "$f" 2>/dev/null && git add "$f" && echo "✓ theirs:  $f" ;;
    rebrand) git checkout --theirs "$f" 2>/dev/null && sed -i "$REBRAND" "$f" && git add "$f" && echo "✓ rebrand: $f" ;;
    extpkg)  git checkout --theirs "$f" 2>/dev/null && sed -i "$EXT_PKG" "$f" && git add "$f" && echo "✓ extpkg:  $f" ;;
    rm)      git rm -f "$f" 2>/dev/null && echo "✓ removed: $f" || true ;;
    *) echo "ERROR: unknown strategy '$strategy' for '$f'" >&2; return 1 ;;
  esac
}

# === keepOurs (<N> files) ===
resolve "Dockerfile" ours
# ... one line per file in keepOurs

# === acceptWithRebrand (<N> files) ===
resolve "src/agents/minion-tools.ts" rebrand
# ... one line per file in acceptWithRebrand

# === extensionPackageJson (<N> files) ===
resolve "extensions/bluebubbles/package.json" extpkg
# ... one line per file in extensionPackageJson

# === acceptDeletion (<N> files) ===
resolve ".agents/AGENT_SUBMISSION_CONTROL_POLICY.md" rm
# ... one line per file in acceptDeletion

# === autoAccept (<N> files) ===
resolve "docs/channels/telegram.md" theirs
# ... one line per file in autoAccept

# === MANUAL MERGE REQUIRED (<N> files) ===
# NOT resolved by this script — Claude handles these in Phase 2 Step 5.
# <file>: <notes from mergeShoppingList>

echo ""
echo "✓ Auto-resolution complete."
echo "MANUAL: Resolve these files, then: git add . && git merge --continue"
# list manualMerge files here as echo lines
```

**Category → strategy mapping:**

| Shopping list category | Script strategy |
| ---------------------- | --------------- |
| `keepOurs`             | `ours`          |
| `acceptWithRebrand`    | `rebrand`       |
| `extensionPackageJson` | `extpkg`        |
| `acceptDeletion`       | `rm`            |
| `autoAccept`           | `theirs`        |
| `manualMerge`          | comment only    |

**Save and commit:**

```bash
chmod +x .claude/skills/fork-sync/scripts/resolve-conflicts.sh
git add .claude/skills/fork-sync/scripts/resolve-conflicts.sh
git commit -m "feat(fork-sync): Phase 1.7 — generate conflict resolution script"
```

**If the script already exists**: overwrite it — the shopping list may have been updated by a delta update.

### Phase 2: Update DEV Branch (Worktree Method)

**Goal**: Merge updated mirror into DEV using an isolated git worktree — immune to parallel git sessions in the main workspace.

**Prerequisite**: Phase 1.7 resolution script exists at `.claude/skills/fork-sync/scripts/resolve-conflicts.sh`. Run Phase 1.7 first if it doesn't.

```bash
# Step 1: Verify resolution script is present
ls .claude/skills/fork-sync/scripts/resolve-conflicts.sh

# Step 2: Create isolated worktree pointing at DEV
git worktree add ../openclaw-merge-worktree DEV

# Step 3: Merge mirror into worktree (--no-commit to allow pre-commit resolution)
git -C ../openclaw-merge-worktree merge mirror --no-commit --no-ff

# Step 4: Run resolution script from within the worktree directory
# (script uses relative git commands, must run from worktree root)
cd ../openclaw-merge-worktree
bash ../<repo-dir>/.claude/skills/fork-sync/scripts/resolve-conflicts.sh

# Step 5: Manually resolve manualMerge files listed by the script
# Inspect each, resolve hunks per the script's comment notes
# Common files: package.json, .github/workflows/ci.yml, .github/workflows/docker-release.yml

# Step 6: Commit the merge
git -C ../openclaw-merge-worktree commit -m "Merge upstream changes from mirror"

# Step 7: Push DEV
git -C ../openclaw-merge-worktree push origin DEV

# Step 8: Cleanup
git worktree remove ../openclaw-merge-worktree
```

**Why worktrees prevent interruption**: The main workspace can be on any branch. Commits, checkouts, and stash pops in the main workspace have zero effect on the worktree. The active merge state lives in `../openclaw-merge-worktree/.git/MERGE_HEAD` — a completely separate directory.

**Recovery if interrupted** (session ends, error, parallel git activity):

```bash
# Full reset in ~30 seconds
git worktree remove --force ../openclaw-merge-worktree
git worktree add ../openclaw-merge-worktree DEV
git -C ../openclaw-merge-worktree merge mirror --no-commit --no-ff
cd ../openclaw-merge-worktree
bash ../<repo-dir>/.claude/skills/fork-sync/scripts/resolve-conflicts.sh
# ... then Step 5 (manualMerge), Step 6 (commit), Step 7 (push), Step 8 (cleanup)
```

**Expected**: Resolution script resolves ~925 of 928 conflicts in under 60 seconds. Claude manually handles the 3 `manualMerge` files only.

**Note**: Feature branches and main (production) are not synced automatically. Update them manually when needed.

## Safety Checks

### Pre-Sync Checklist

Before starting the sync workflow:

- [ ] Working directory is clean (`git status`)
- [ ] No uncommitted changes that could conflict
- [ ] WIP changes stashed or committed (`git stash` if needed) — avoids partial-staging complexity during sync
- [ ] Upstream remote is configured (`git remote -v | grep upstream`)
- [ ] Latest upstream fetched (`git fetch upstream`)
- [ ] Mirror is clean mirror (no divergence from upstream)

### Verification Commands

After completing sync:

```bash
# Verify mirror matches upstream
git log --oneline mirror..upstream/main  # Should be empty

# Verify branch relationships
git log --oneline --graph --all --decorate -20

# Verify DEV contains mirror's commits
git merge-base --is-ancestor mirror DEV && echo "✓ DEV contains mirror" || echo "✗ DEV missing mirror commits"
```

### Post-Sync Checklist

- [ ] `mirror` matches `upstream/main` (no divergence)
- [ ] `mirror` pushed to `origin/mirror`
- [ ] `DEV` merged mirror successfully
- [ ] `DEV` pushed to remote
- [ ] Docker workflows still functional (optional: verify builds)

**Note**: Feature branches and main (production) are not synced automatically. Update them manually when needed.

## Conflict Resolution

### Mirror Has Custom Commits

**Problem**: `git merge --ff-only upstream/main` fails with "Not possible to fast-forward"

**Root Cause**: Mirror contains custom commits (violates clean mirror principle)

**Solution**:

1. Verify custom commits exist on DEV/main: `git log --oneline DEV | head`
2. Reset mirror to upstream: `git reset --hard upstream/main`
3. Force push: `git push --force-with-lease origin mirror`
4. Continue normal workflow (merge mirror → DEV)

### Merge Conflicts in DEV

If conflicts occur when merging mirror into DEV:

1. **Identify conflicts**: `git status` shows conflicted files
2. **Common conflict areas**:
   - Docker configurations (if upstream changed docker-compose.yml)
   - Workflow files (if upstream changed .github/workflows/\*)
   - Core files modified by both upstream and custom work

3. **Evaluate upstream vs fork for each conflict**:

   Do NOT default to keeping fork changes. For each conflicted hunk, ask:
   - **Is the upstream change an architectural improvement?** (e.g. new type field, refactored API, better pattern) — If yes, adopt upstream and adapt fork changes to fit the new structure.
   - **Does upstream solve the same problem differently?** — Compare both approaches. The upstream solution may be more robust, better tested, or aligned with the project's direction.
   - **Is the fork change purely additive?** (e.g. new config field, new import) — If yes, keep both: accept upstream's changes AND add the fork-specific additions.
   - **Are they independent changes to the same region?** — Keep both, adjusting whitespace/ordering as needed.

   **Rule of thumb**: Upstream is the source of truth for architecture. Fork changes should layer on top of upstream, not override it. When in doubt, adopt upstream and re-apply fork additions.

4. **Complete merge**:
   ```bash
   git add <resolved-files>
   git commit -m "Merge upstream changes, resolve conflicts"
   git push origin DEV
   ```

### Abort/Rollback

If issues occur during merge:

```bash
# Abort current merge
git merge --abort

# Reset to previous state
git reflog  # Find previous commit
git reset --hard HEAD@{1}

# Or restore from remote
git reset --hard origin/<branch-name>
```

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Regular Upstream Sync (Weekly/Bi-weekly)

When upstream has new commits and you want to pull them in:

1. **Phase 0**: Check if mirror is clean (should be)
2. **Phase 1**: Merge upstream/main → mirror (fast-forward)
3. **Phase 2**: Merge mirror → DEV
4. **Time**: ~3-5 minutes

**Note**: Feature branches and main (production) are not auto-synced. Update manually when needed.

### Scenario 2: Mirror Has Diverged

When mirror accidentally contains custom commits:

1. **Phase 0**: Verify commits on DEV/main, reset mirror to upstream
2. Continue with normal workflow
3. **Time**: ~2-3 minutes extra

### Scenario 3: Emergency Hotfix from Upstream

When upstream has a critical fix you need immediately:

1. Sync mirror (fast-forward)
2. Cherry-pick to DEV if urgent: `git cherry-pick <commit-sha>`
3. Or run full workflow if you have time

## Quick Sync Script

For routine syncs (assumes mirror is already clean):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Quick sync script

set -e  # Exit on error

echo "🔄 Starting fork sync workflow..."

# Fetch upstream
git fetch upstream

# Phase 1: Sync mirror
echo "📥 Phase 1: Syncing mirror with upstream..."
git checkout mirror
git merge --ff-only upstream/main
git push origin mirror

# Phase 2: Update DEV
echo "🔧 Phase 2: Updating DEV branch..."
git checkout DEV
git merge mirror -m "Merge upstream changes from mirror"
git push origin DEV

echo "✅ Fork sync complete!"
echo "💡 Feature branches and main (production) are not auto-synced. Update them manually when needed."
git log --oneline --graph --all --decorate -10
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep mirror clean**: NEVER commit custom work to mirror
2. **All custom work on DEV**: Commit custom changes to DEV or feature branches
3. **Sync regularly**: Weekly or bi-weekly to avoid large merge conflicts
4. **Clean working directory**: Always start with `git status` showing clean
5. **Stash before sync**: Commit or stash all WIP before starting — avoids partial-staging headaches and stash/pop friction during branch switches
6. **Review upstream changes**: Use `git log mirror..upstream/main` before merging
7. **Test after sync**: Verify Docker images build successfully
8. **DEV before main**: Always test in DEV before merging to main (production)

## Troubleshooting

### "fatal: Not possible to fast-forward"

**Cause**: Mirror has custom commits (diverged from upstream)

**Fix**: Run Phase 0 (Clean Mirror) first

### "error: Your local changes would be overwritten"

**Cause**: Uncommitted changes in working directory

**Fix**:

```bash
git status  # Review changes
git stash   # Temporarily save changes
# Run sync workflow
git stash pop  # Restore changes after sync
```

### "Updates were rejected because the remote contains work"

**Cause**: Remote branch has commits not in local branch

**Fix**:

```bash
git pull --rebase origin <branch-name>
# Resolve conflicts if any
git push origin <branch-name>
```

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when:

- "Sync with upstream"
- "Update fork from minion/minion"
- "Pull latest from upstream"
- "Update all branches"
- "Sync DEV with upstream"
- "Fork workflow" or "fork-sync"
- "Evaluate upstream" or "resume evaluation" (Phase 1.6)
- Before starting major feature work (to start from latest upstream)
- After seeing mirror has diverged from upstream
- When a bulk merge produces too many conflicts (triggers Phase 1.6)
